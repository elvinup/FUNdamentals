    "Given an array of heights, each of which represents a vertical line on a graph, find the point at which the maximum amount of water can be stored. \n",

    "\n",
    "Looking at the graph, it is apparent that we could easily do this in O(n^2) by checking each pair of lines to see which one has the highest volume of water (doing length x width)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easier way to do this, however, is to simply have 2 pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have i = 0, j = len(array)-1, so essentially 2 pointers on each side of the graph. Have them go inwards one iteration at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "- The maximum amount of water capacity is bottlenecked only by the side with the smaller height.\n",
    "  - This means we need to update the highest height (on both sides) we’ve seen so far as the two pointers get closer to each other.\n",
    "- We need to sacrifice width every time we move a pointer. With this in mind, it makes sense to move a pointer if it hasn’t found a height bigger than the other pointer yet. In other words, only the smaller pointer should be moving in hopes to find a bigger height.\n",
    "- The formula to calculate height will be (j-i) * min(max_i, max_j) because the smaller one will dictate how much water can be trapped.\n",
