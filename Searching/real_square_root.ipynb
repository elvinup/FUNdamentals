    "# 11.5 Takeaway - Compute Square root, given a float value\n",
    "\n",
    "At first as I was thinking about this problem, I thought the most straightforward solution was to just start at 1 as a lower bound and square it until we go over the expected answer,\n",
    "\n",
    "So like if we're asked to compute the square root of 25\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1*1 = 1\n",
    "2*2 = 4\n",
    "3*3 = 9\n",
    "4*4 = 16\n",
    "5*5 = 25 # Found!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if given a floating point number like 30.25\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1*1 = 1\n",
    "...\n",
    "5*5 = 25\n",
    "6*6 = 36 # Wow too far, now lets starting iterating but every .1, or 10% less than where we started\n",
    "\n",
    "5.1*5.1 = ?\n",
    "5.2*5.2 = ?\n",
    "...\n",
    "5.5*5.5 = 30.25 # Found \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works, but this is moreso a O(n) solution. And we've seen with other problems, like the division without division problem, or int_sqiare_root (11.4), we can do this in O(logn) if we implement the principles of binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we can simple set a lower and upperbound from (1, x)\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a **Gotcha!** This problem also allows for numbers < 1. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "`1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we need to set the lowerbound at `x` and upperbound as 1, if the number we're looking for is < 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, just set the midpoint by multiplying the (upper + lower) bounds * 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this works exactly like binary search as below:"
