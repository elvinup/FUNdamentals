    "# Timer Class - 19.8 Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a timer class that manages the execution of deferred tasks. The timer constructor takes as its argument an object which includes a run method and a string valued name field. The class must support\n",
    "\n",
    "- starting a thread, identified by name, at a given time in the future\n",
    "- canceling a thread, identified by name (the cancel request is to be ignored if the thread has already started).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a heap and a hash table to keep track of the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The min heap is perfect for ordering the tasks by time and popping accordingly. Entries into the heap should be a tuple with this value:\n",
    "\n",
    "`entry = (launch_time, task_id, task)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the hashtable, we can keep correlate the task_id with the entries that pop out of the heapq. It's perfect for cancelling tasks that haven't been scheduled yet, because we can easily use a `del` operation on a hastable key-value pair, and then when we pop the entry out of the queue, if it's not in the hash table, we can assume the task was cancelled and skip the run of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use a simple 1 counter semaphore for all reads and writes into the hash table and heap queue."
