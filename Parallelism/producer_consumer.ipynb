    "# Producer Consumer Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Explained well in [this article](https://www.askpython.com/python/producer-consumer-problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we need to make use of **semaphores** relating to the capacity of our array/buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's 3 main pieces here\n",
    "\n",
    "- The buffer or array with a fixed capacity\n",
    "- Producer thread class which add to the array in a circular queue fashion\n",
    "  - Can only produce when the array isn't at capacity\n",
    "- Consumer thread class which reads from the array in a circular queue fashion\n",
    "  - Can only read when there's something to read\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we need a mutual semaphore lock between the producer and consumer so they don't run into a race condition on the same index\n",
    "\n",
    "The main trick is to have one semaphore acquire when producing, and release the opposite semaphore when done. vice versa with the consumer but opposite semaphores.\n",
    "The only thing in common will be the mutual mutex lock between them, so both are working with two semaphores."
