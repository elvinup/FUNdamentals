    "# 18.7 Takeaway - Transform one String to another\n",

    "Given a Set `D` filled with strings of the same length, and two strings `s` and `t` that also have the same length, compute the length of the shortest sequence to turn `s` into `t` using strings in `D`. Each transformation involves changing 1 letter at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "D = {bat, cot, dog, dag, dot, cat}\n",
    "s = cat\n",
    "t = dog\n",
    "```\n",

    "- Thinking about this problem, it's evident that it would be way too expensive to try every combination and go down every path.\n",
    "- Considering the word path, this can be similar to a graph problem if we consider the vertices as the words in the dictionary, and the edges as words that are a difference of 1 to those vertices. It's a good idea to take a graph approach to this problem.\n",
    "- Since the problem asks for a shortest path aka an optimization, we should likely use BFS to get there.\n",
    "- Let's start by building the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../%20images/string_transform_example_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - To do this, we need to create a vertex out of every item in D. \n",
    "  - Then we need to compare against every other word to see if the edit distance = 1. likely with a double for loop (O(D^2) runtime)\n",
    "- After the graph is built, we can do a simple BFS shortest path algorithm to get there\n",
    "  - Have a queue starting the (s, 0), 0 representing how many transformations we've had to make\n",
    "  - Every time we pop a node and go through it's neighbor strings, we need to append (neighbor of s, +1) to the queue\n",
    "  - When the node popped = string `t`, return the count\n",
    "- If we reach the end of the queue, return -1 because it wasn't found to be possible to reach `t`\n",
