    "- Short array with ~10 or fewer elements? -> Insertion sort is quick to code faster than O(faster) algorithms\n",
    "- Elements known to be at most k places from final location? -> min-heap can be a O(n log k) algorithm\n",
    "- Small number of distinct keys e.g. [0-255]? -> Counting sort \n",
    "    - records for each element, the # of elements less than it\n",
    "    - If largest number is comparable in value to the size of the set being sorted, use an array\n",
    "    - Or use a BST. Keys are the numbers, values are the frequencies. Use a linked list for elements with duplicate keys. Inorder traversal can be done to get the order.\n",
