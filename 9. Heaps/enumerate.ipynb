    "In this problem, we are tasked with merging multiple sorted arrays into one.\n",

    "This is harder than the easy problem of just merging 2 sorted arrays where you can just grab the min of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY WORD: SORTED!\n",
    "\n",
    "If a problem tells you stuff is already sorted, you almost 100% of the time need to take advantage of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it's easy to keep the heap size as large as the number of arrays, by just getting the minimum of each array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Tip: If an element can potentially be the number `0`, do NOT say `if elem:` as your condition, instead use `if elem is not None:`\n",
    "This is because you could skip 0's if you needed to include them. This happened to me while dealing with this problem..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enumerate\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's enumerate is great for grabbing an iterator and the index number"
