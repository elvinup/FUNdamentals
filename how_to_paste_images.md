# How to Paste Images

In order to view them in .ipynb Jupyter Notebooks while in VSCode

1. Install the `Paste Image` extension

2. Set the `images/` folder from the project root or wherever preferred

3. Type the name of the image you want in your markdown like `example_image` in plain text. Not with the "`" symbol around it.

4. Select the text and do a `Ctrl-Alt-v` to paste the image directly in your project's `images/` folder from its root and easily view it from your .md file!
