    "\n",
    "A key insight is to note that if you take the left half of a number, so for our example that would be\n",

    "`1010` and XOR (^) that with the original number `1010 0100`\n",

    "\n",
    "**XOR with left 4 bits**\n",
    "\n",
    "1010 0100 ^ 1010 = 1110\n",
    "\n",
    "Still odd parity with five 1's.\n",
    "\n",
    "**XOR with left 2 bits**\n",
    "\n",
    "1110 ^ 11 = 01\n",
    "\n",
    "Still odd parity with one 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**XOR with left 1 bit**\n",
    "\n",
    "01 ^ 0 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Still odd parity!\n",
    "\n",
    "1 is our final answer, and this example shows how we can logarithmically find out if a large number like a 64 bit number has an even or odd parity super quick using the power of `XOR`"
