    "# Topological Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "This is typically used when you need to model a graph with directed edges where some events need to happen before others. It is just a way to order nodes around like so:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topological Orderings are not unique\n",
    "- Runtime: O(V + E)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event Scheduling\n",
    "- Alien Dictionary Problem (Find which letters in an alien dictionary are their \"ABC\" order)\n",

    "- Doesn't work if there's a **cycle** in the graph or if it's edges are bidirectional.\n",
    "- Only works on DAGs or Directed Acyclic graphs\n",
    "- All rooted trees work since they typically don't have cycles\n",

    "## Kahn's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove nodes without dependencies repeatedly and add them to a queue\n",
    "  - These will be represented as an array or dictionary where each is mapped to an **incoming degree**, or number of incoming directed edges to that node\n",
    "- As these nodes are removed, new nodes should have no dependencies and available to use\n",
    "- Repeat until all nodes are processed, or cycle is discovered"
