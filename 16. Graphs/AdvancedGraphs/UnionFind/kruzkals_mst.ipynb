    "\n",
    "A relevant problem to practice Kruzkal's MST is this leetcode problem called [Min Cost to Collect All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we are given a random set of coordinates on a 2D grid. The cost to make an edge between any two coordinates has been chosen for us to be the **manhattan distance**, which is `x1 - y1 + x2 - y2`. We must figure out what would be the least costly way to make all points connected with edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "After learning about Minimum Spanning Trees, it should be evident that an MST is pretty much what this problem is asking for, but without the edges already generated. So essentially, we need to generate all the different combinations of two points as edges and their costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create the UnionFind Class since this is an MST problem\n",
    "- Generate Edge object tuples as (distance, pointA, pointB)\n",
    "  - We set distance as the first object so it's super easy to just sort them by distance\n",
    "- Sort edges in increasing order\n",
    "- Loop through edges in that order\n",
    "  - if a set of points are able to be unified, then add the cost to a global cost variable\n",
    "  - also subtract from a variable that keeps track of the number of points, so that we know when to stop out of the algorithm\n",
    "- Return cost\n",
