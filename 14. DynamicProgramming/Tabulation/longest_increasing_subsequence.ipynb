    "# 16.12 Takeaway - Longest Increasing Subsequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Count the longest increasing subsequence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "nums = [4,10,4,3,8,9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer = 3 b/c of [4,8,9]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unoptimized\n",
    "\n",
    "The unoptimized solution isn't even really worth writing, but it's O(2^n) as you need to go through the array and either choose a number as part of your subsequence, or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "This was really tricky, but what really helped clear confusion was that our dp array at the end of our earlier example should not result like this\n",
    "\n",
    "dp = `[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "but rather should look like this\n",
    "\n",
    "dp = `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we will have to return the max(dp) instead of the usual dp[-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we need to have 2 pointers, `i` and `j` which can go back and tell us what the largest subsequence is at each new iteration. It helps to initialize everything as `1` in our dp array, since that's by default the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we use the dp array to cache our earlier answers. As we're swinging back through, with the `j loop`, we want to save our latest maximum for dp[i], and we want to just make sure everytime a number we saw earlier was smaller that we check if we can get a new maximum."
