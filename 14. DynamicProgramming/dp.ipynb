    "### Pros\n",
    "- Easier to code edge cases and gets less complicated\n",
    "- More natural to think about\n",

    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "- Faster performance by getting info directly from a table\n",
    "- If all subproblems need to be solved at least once, bottom up performs better"

    "- Example: Longest Increasing Subsequence\n",

    "### Pattern 2\n",
    "- Input: Array length n\n",
    "- Subproblem: Ordered subsequence of length i, but in random order\n",
    "- Example: Box stacking problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 3\n",
    "- Input: 2 arrays length n and m\n",
    "- Subproblem: Ordered subsequence of length i, Ordered subsequence of length j\n",
    "- Note: Slightly more complex version of above problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 4\n",
    "- Input: Array length n\n",
    "- Subproblem: subsequence expanding from the middle of the array, and going outwards left and right\n",
    "- Note: Not quite as common as above patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 5\n",
    "- Input: 2D Matrix Array of dimensions m x n\n",
    "- Subproblem: Sub-matrix of sub dimension i x j\n",
    "- Note: Some of the most common DP problems use a 2D matrix"
