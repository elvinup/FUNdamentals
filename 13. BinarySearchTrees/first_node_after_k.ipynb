    "Another naiive solution i had was doing an inorder traversal until we found our key, and just returned the next inorder value. Problem is, the next key could be above it, and inorder doesn’t go above the root it starts from. For example, input = 3, output = 5\n",

    "Don’t capture k, it is greater than the current node. We’re looking for the first number after the k node."
