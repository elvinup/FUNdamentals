    "# 13.8 Takeaway - Computing the Union of Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of intervals, output the union expressed as a set of disjoint intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intervals look like\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval = collections.namedTuple(‘Interval’, (‘left’, ‘right’))\n",
    "\n",
    "Endpoint = collections.namedTuple(‘Endpoint’, (‘val’, ‘is_closed’))\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Interval Object is made up of 2 Endpoint objects!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "Will need a results variable to store the intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to sort this data, at least by value. \n",
    "\n",
    "value. \n",
    "is_left value (starting takes priority in case of tie breaks)\n",
    "is_closed (not is_closed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we sort the intervals by left value, and whether or not it was open or closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Early Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Don't just sort all the endpoints in 1 array \n",
    "\n",
    "It's tempting to gather all the endpoints, and sort them ranked in this order like in problem 13.6\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to justify using the counter method when we have intervals defined. D is the difference between values. if we have to go through each value, that’s much more times spent if D is huge, than if we just iterate through the interval objects themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are NOT using the counter like in 13.6, because in that problem we needed to figure out the max concurrent events (vertical) at any given time, so we needed to go through each value anyway. For this problem, we’re just looking for how long (horizontal) the intervals are, and tracking them as we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forgot how Unions worked\n",
    "\n",
    "A Union of intervals only happens if they intersect, or if their endpoints are aligned and at least one of them has a closing brace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if 2 interval values are equal, but they are both open brace “(“ or “)”, they are NOT part of the same interval! So at least 1 single closed brace “[“, or “]” is required to include the 2 interval values, or if they intersect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fundamental property of unions that I didn't take into account when first doing this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "We add the first endpoint after sorting to start the results list. As we iterate through intervals, we refer back to the previous endpoint's right value, and our current endpoint's left value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Add a new endpoint if: \n",
    "    - the curr left value is > the previous interval’s right value\n",
    "    - the curr left val == prev right value and they're both open braced (2 open braces means they're not part of the same union)\n",
    "\n",
    "ELSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the previous interval entry's right value if:\n",
    "    - curr right value > prev right value\n",
    "    - curr right value == prev right value, and the curr right value is a closed brace\n"
